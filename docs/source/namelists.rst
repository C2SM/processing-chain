Namelist Templates
------------------

Namelists for **int2lm** and **COSMO** are generated using templates which are also located in
the cases-directory. These templates are essentially textfiles containing "normal" namelist
parameters and python-variables in curly braces.

These files get read by their respective job.
The resulting string is formatted using python's ``.format()``-function which replaces the
python-variables with their value. The formatted strings are then saved as namelist-files in the
run-directory of their respective jobs and then read by the executable. ::

  cases/example/example_namelist.cfg -> [read file] ->
  "exvar = '{cfg.prefix}{cfg.suffix}'" -> ["".format(cfg)] ->
  "exvar = 'pref_suff.nc'" -> [write to disk] ->
  int2lm/run/example_namelist

The same procedure is done for the slurm-runscripts for **int2lm** and **COSMO**.

A special case is ``INPUT_ART`` for **int2lm** and ``INPUT_GHG`` for **COSMO** . These namelists are
generated by :func:`jobs.tools.write_int2lm_input_art.main` and :func:`jobs.tools.write_cosmo_input_ghg.main`
from ``.csv``-files containing all necessary information.
