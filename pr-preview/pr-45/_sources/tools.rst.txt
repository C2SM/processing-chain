Tools
=====

The tools are a collection of functions used by the jobs. Most of those
functions are well documented and listed here. For others, one may take 
a look into ``jobs/tools`` directly.

Conversion Functions
--------------------

These functions are used by the job :func:`jobs.prepare_data.main`. They convert data into
a format usable by **int2lm**
